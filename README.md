React is always a big adventure, cause you need to be careful about the dependencies. It's like your trip bag, don't forget your toothpaste !
I encountered a lot of issues 
1- vscode crashed after cancelling all changes cause needed action
2- babel issues
3- jshint issues
4- npm start issues
etc...
