React is always a big adventure, cause you need to be careful about the dependencies. 

It's like your trip bag, don't forget your toothpaste !

I encountered a lot of issues :
1. vscode crashed after cancelling all changes cause needed action

3. jshint issues <div><img src="https://github.com/jsr029/P12-last/blob/master/jshintIssues.PNG" alt="jshint issue" /></div>
4. npm start issues <div><img src="https://github.com/jsr029/P12-last/blob/master/npmStartIssue.PNG" alt="npm start issues" /></div>
5. etc...

# How to get rid of those issues ?
- yarn add instead of npm install
- and even if npm start doesn't work, try yarn start
- npm i react-dom react
- npm i --save-dev @types/react-dom @types/react

# For this dashboard app, I needed to add some dependencies
let's have a look at my frontend package.json
